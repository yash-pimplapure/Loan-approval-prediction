Loan Approval Prediction Project

Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval using machine learning techniques.
The model leverages historical loan application data to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to loan applications,
such as applicant income, loan amount, employment status, and more.
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

Features
Applicant Income
Loan Amount

Model
The project uses a Support Vector Classifier model to predict loan approval.
The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python predict_loan_approval.py

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting loan approval.
Future work could include exploring other machine learning models and feature engineering techniques.
